### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11707/> *Solar Flareâ€“CME Coupling Throughout Two Acceleration Phases of a Fast CME*

In this paper, the authors investigate the relationship between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares by studying a fast CME and its associated flare that occurred on May 13, 2013. (Coronal mass ejections are events where solar material is ejected from the sun, whereas flares are the sudden brightening of the star's photosphere thought to be associated with the CME) They show that the two-stage CME acceleration corresponds to the two-stage energy release of the associated flare, noting that the second stage of the flare releases far higher energy than the first and that the magnetic reconnection process continues throughout the flare's long decay phase.


### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Detrended a test lightcurve using PCA by removing/bandpass-filtering principal components responsible for the majority of variance in the power spectra/DFT. Used the inverse-FFT to reconstruct the lightcurve using the removed/filtered components.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: Box-and-whisker plots of the first 5 principle components of the power spectra. The distribution of Component 1 is nearly entirely positive, indicating that the first component
plays an important part in the reconstruction of all power spectra, suggesting it contains information of systematic noise.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

We can now reasonably demonstrate that PCA can be used to detrend & denoise light curves by filtering components that generate high variance and 
only using components that explain up to 95% of the variance (~200 components). The DFT can be reconstructed from the remaining components, then 
inverting the reconstructed transform returns the detrended lightcurve. 

### 3.2 Goals (Delivery Date)

Next week, I will work on bandpass filtering the initial DFT principal components (7/1), filtering the harmonics from the principle components (7/1), making box plots of the 
DFT principle components (6/28), and running a larger sample of light curves through the PCA detrending process (7/1).

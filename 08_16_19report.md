/<https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11185/> Paudel et al. 2018: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey. IV. Monster flares observed on the young brown dwarf CFHT-BD-Tau 4

(in progress, with the candidacy exam right around the corner, I've been devoting almost all my reading time to reading textbooks, so I haven't finished reading this paper yet)

### 1.2 Code Written

BiancoGroup2019.ipynb: Identified flares in ED vs time curve by grouping consecutive ED data points above 1 sigma. Chose maximum of each group of above-1-sigma data points as the ED of the flare. Used median of each rolling window to convert x-axis labels to time (BJD-2454833). Added histogram of flare EDs.

## 3 Results 

After going through the light curve with the rolling window to calculate the equivalent durations (EDs), I split the ED data into subsets of consecutive points above the 1-sigma line. Each subset should theoretically correspond to a single flare, as a 10-point window should effectively avoid enclosing two distinct flares. Also encouraging is the fact that a 10-point window recovered 50 sets of consecutive points above 1-sigma, i.e. 50 flares, which is the same number of flares Rishi found on this star! I replotted the ED plot with the maximum ED of each subset highlighted (Figure 1).

Previously the horizontal axis of the ED plot was "window step", but I converted this to time in days by assigning a time to each ED point that equals the median of its corresponding window. With the max ED of each consecutive set and the corresponding time, we can plot the equivalent duration of the flare in days vs. time, as in Figure 2. I also made a quick histogram of the flare EDs (Figure 3), which appears consistent with the star's FFD, since ED is a proxy for flare energy.

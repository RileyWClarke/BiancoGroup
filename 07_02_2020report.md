## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

I modified the inverted gaussian filter to filter the harmonics from the first principal component of the discrete fourier transforms. 
Results are, by inspection, very similar to only filtering the "fundamental" from the PC, but it stands to reason that removing the harmonics would only improve 
the effectiveness of the method. I also began a draft of an AAS-templated paper, and uploaded some of the more relevant figures and added appropriate captions.

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on adding more structure to the paper, specifically an abstract and some introductory text (Delivery: 7/8), as well as running some objects of interest
(EPIC 211046195,EPIC 210327027, & EPIC 211110493) through the PCA detrending process (Delivery: 7/8). I will also attempt to convert the PCA detrending process into a Python script
that will eliminate the need for using notebooks. (Delivery: 7/10)

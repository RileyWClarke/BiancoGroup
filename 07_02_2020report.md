### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08745/>: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey. II. The White Light Flare Rate of Young Brown Dwarfs

(This is the paper that discusses the objects that Dr. Gizis asked us to try the PCA process on)

In this paper, the authors discuss white light flares detected in short-cadence K2 photometry of two young, moving group brown dwarfs, as well as a superflare detected in long-cadence photometry of a Pleiades brown dwarf. They create flare frequency distributions for the M7 moving group brown dwarf, and find a power-law slope similar to the Sun and other warmer flaring stars. However, they found no flares on the L5 dwarf, despite its rapid rotation and young age, both of which are factors thought to increase stellar magnetic activity. This suggests fast magnetic reconnection is suppressed below a certain critical temperature, around ~1500 K. The observation of the 2.4 * 10^24 erg superflare demonstrated that brown dwarfs are also capable of producing very large flares of similar energy to those emitted by the most active M-dwarfs.

### 1.2 Code Written

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

I modified the inverted gaussian filter to filter the harmonics from the first principal component of the discrete fourier transforms. 
Results are, by inspection, very similar to only filtering the "fundamental" from the PC, but it stands to reason that removing the harmonics would only improve 
the effectiveness of the method. I also began a draft of an AAS-templated paper, and uploaded some of the more relevant figures and added appropriate captions.

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on adding more structure to the paper, specifically an abstract and some introductory text (Delivery: 7/8), as well as running some objects of interest
(EPIC 211046195,EPIC 210327027, & EPIC 211110493) through the PCA detrending process (Delivery: 7/8). I will also attempt to convert the PCA detrending process into a Python script
that will eliminate the need for using notebooks. (Delivery: 7/10)

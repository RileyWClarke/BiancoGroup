## 3 Results 

Figure 2 shows the equivalent duration calculated for each 10-datapoint window as it rolls through the lightcurve shown in Figure 1. In principle, each spike in equivalent duration should correspond to a flare, as the window picks up more and more high-flux datapoints. The wider features at the right end of the ED curve are confusing however, perhaps these are complex flares, or flares with separations smaller than the window size? 

Next step would be to take consecutive EDs above some sigma value and find the maximum of each set of consecutive values to get the time and ED of the flare. I've highlighted the 1-sigma and 3-sigma deviations from the median ED. The 3-sigma cut would miss a lot of the smaller features, so proceeding with a 1-sigma clip on the ED is probably the way to go.

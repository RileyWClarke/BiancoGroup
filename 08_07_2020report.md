# Riley Clarke - Week of 08/07/2020

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/128/965/075002/>: That's How We Roll: The NASA K2 Mission Science Products and Their Performance Metrics

In this paper, the authors discuss the successor to the Kepler mission, reborn as K2, and the performance challenges that arose as a result of the measures taken to
continue the mission. The original Kepler mission ran into problems when one of the reaction wheels used to point the spacecraft failed, requiring NASA to use the remaining
wheels in conjuction with radiation pressure on the solar panel to keep Kepler pointed at fields in the ecliptic for up to 80 days each. This solution requires the spacecraft
to fire thrusters every 6 hours to keep spacecraft roll within acceptable limits, which introduces a sawtooth noise pattern on the obtained lightcurves as the targets
jitter about in the frame. This paper will be a good source going forward for discussing systematic noise in K2 photometry.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

Using the simple gaussian filtering model shown in Figure 1, I noticed that the peak of the convolution output is at the 100th index, and the gaussian signal and filter are centered at the 50th index.
Experimenting with offsetting the filter from the signal, I noticed that the location of the convolution peak was always the sum of the filter location and signal location, i.e. if the filter was placed at 30, 
and the signal was centered at 50, the peak of the convolution array would be at 80. I think this will provide some insight on how to use the convolution of the Gabor filter
with the ringing signal. 

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on using the convolution of the Gabor filter with the ringing signal to find the optimal place to place the Gabor filter and then tweak the parameters of the filter to
reduce the ringing as much as possible. (8/12) 

I will also add an intro paragraph to explain Principle Component Analysis. (8/12)

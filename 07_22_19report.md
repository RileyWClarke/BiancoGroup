### 1.1 Papers Read

\<https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07631\>: Davenport et al. 2016, The Kepler Catalog of Stellar Flares

This paper presents a catalog of 851168 candidate flare events across 4041 stars in the Kepler database. Total relative flare luminosity is compared to Rossby number for stars with reliable periods. A power law decay in flare activity is found for the flare frequency diagrams and flare luminosity vs Rossby number plots. For the flare luminosity-rotation plot, a broken power law is found to be preferred by a Bayesian Information Criterion test for stars with spectral type later than G8.

\<https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08745\>: Gizis et al. 2017,K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey II: The White Light Flare Rate of Young Brown Dwarfs

This paper uses K2 Campaign 4 short cadence data to analyze WLFs in brown dwarf moving groups. No flares were detected above 2*10^30 erg in the brown dwarf 2M0355+11, suggesting magnetic reconnection is suppressed in cool atmospheres. Some complex-structured flares were detected as well.

### 1.2 Code Written

## 3 Results 

Some of the FFDs are quite well fitted by the broken power laws, but not so for some others, especially those for which the lower-energy flares were recovered more efficiently. A Bayesian approach to fitting the broken power laws will probably produce better fits, but I'm still not sure how to go about retrieving uncertainties on the flare energies. Rishi's paper does not go into specifics about how the equivalent duration was calculated, i.e. which data points were counted as flare fluxes and which were quiescent fluxes and also what were the limits of integration used to determine the ED. Unfortunately Rishi doesn't have a Github (that I could find) and while he does have some code published online, it doesn't shed light onto this particular problem.

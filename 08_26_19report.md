### 1.1 Papers Read

/<https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11185/> Paudel et al. 2018: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey. IV. Monster flares observed on the young brown dwarf CFHT-BD-Tau 4

In this paper, the authors present an observation of the largest flare ever detected on a brown dwarf (CFHT-BD-Tau 4), with an equivalent duration of 107 days, meaning the flare output as much energy as the whole star would in its quiescent state over 107 days! Applying a solar flare model to the flare suggests a magnetic field nearly an order of magnitude stronger than previous estimates. The authors propose that magnetospheric accretion could mimic a strong flare, but that the requisite accretion rate is too great for this to be a likely scenario.

### 1.2 Code Written

BiancoGroup2019.ipynb: Added FFT filtering to lightcurve processing with both a Gaussian and sigmoidal filter.

Figure 2: Original power spectrum of the lightcurve vs the sigmoid-filtered power spectrum. The sigmoid is centered at 0.11 and its amplitude is multiplied by 5000 so that it's visible.

Figure 4: Original power spectrum of the lightcurve vs the gaussian-filtered power spectrum. The gaussian is centered at 0.05 with a standard deviation of 0.005. Its amplitude is multiplied by 5000 so that it's visible.

## 3 Results 

Before we go about calculating the rolling ED, we need to preprocess the lightcurve to remove any underlying signal due to spacecraft systematics, background contamination, etc.  A background signal can be filtered out of the lightcurve by taking the FFT and multiplying the power spectrum by an inverted gaussian centered on the undesired frequency, then taking the inverse Fourier transform of the result. Alternatively a sigmoid may be used to remove all frequencies above/below some value. In Figures 2 & 3 I applied both a sigmoid and gaussian to the lightcurve's power spectrum. Some additional tweaking on the filter parameters may be necessary, and it might be desirable to remove the peak around 0.1 with a second gaussian filter. The filtered lightcurves look mostly reasonable, but it might be a good idea to clip the first and last datapoints since the FFT seems to be giving them crazy high values for some reason.

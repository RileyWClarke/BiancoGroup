# Riley Clarke - Week of 07/01/2019

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

(In progress:)

\<https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07631\>: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey. V. High superflare rates on rapidly rotating late-M dwarfs.  

### 1.2 Code Written

BiancoGroup2019.ipynb: Performed 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of the flare energy distributions of each target in Paudel et al 2018 and vs the distributions of each other target and displayed the results in a heat map. Performed Anderson-Darling test for normal distribution on each target, still working on visualization. Attempted to replicate a flare frequency distribution (FFD) from Paudel et al 2018.

## 3 Results 

In the second figure above, it seems that there is no noticeable trend between K-S test results and spectral types in the range M6-L0, i.e. there is not enough evidence to suggest that flare energy distributions from stars of the same spectral type are drawn from the same distribution.

Additionally, I attempted to replicate and FFD by taking the number of flares of a particular energy and dividing that by total number of days over which the flares in the sample were detected. Not sure if this is the proper way to be doing this, so I should probably ask someone with more experience in making these (i.e. Rishi or Dr. Gizis).

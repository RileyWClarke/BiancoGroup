Silva - Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial

TASK: 
-Write code to grab relevant Kepler/K2 data directly via (MAST?) API

Longer-term goal: 
-Use spectral type / age as the prior for the other
-Predict if flare rate correlated with spectral type
-Add uncertainties to Rishi's linear fit of spectral type flare rates


Make FFDs from flare histograms

Do K-S test on flare histograms
Also, Anderson-Darling test
Bayesian Information Criterion

------

Look up apparent magnitudes of Rishi's targets.

Fit broken power laws

Remove last point from FFDs and re-do fits

------

Go thru light curve with rolling window, get Fc in window with sigma-clipped median, let ED be the maximum Ff-Fc / Fc calculated in window. Disregard windows with no ED, i.e. no flare

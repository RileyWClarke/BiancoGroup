### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15129/>: Integrating Machine Learning for Planetary Science: Perspectives for the Next Decade

In this white paper, the authors discuss the emerging importance of machine learning methods in the field of planetary science. Planetary science is increasingly a data-rich
field with many current and upcoming missions designed to surpass earlier missions in terms of data quanity and detail. Some ideal examples of applications of machine learning 
in planetary science that are mentioned are planning mission trajectories, initial landing site detection, prioritization of observations, and autonomous targeting 
(i.e. identifying features on a planet's surface for follow-up analysis). Among the types of machine learning techniques that are relevant to planetary science applications
are detection, classification, clustering, statistical description of large physical systems.
### 1.2 Code Written

Remade short-candence flare lightcurves using relative flux. Implemented 1D Gabor filter based on skimage.filter 2D implementation.

Figure 1: My version of Figure 2 from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*, showing flares on EPIC 211046195. 
Vertical lines are added at the time of peak flare luminosity. Flux is shown relative to quiescent values.

Figure 2: One-dimensional Gabor filter. The filter has three parameters, lambda, sigma, and nstds. Lambda is the wavelength of the sinusoidal part of the filter,
sigma is the standard deviation of the gaussian envelope part, and nstds is the number of standard deviations included in the time domain of the filter.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

Remaking the short cadence flare light curves with relative flux makes the smaller flares more visible, which helps to show that flares are preserved by the FFT filtering.

The 1D Gabor filter might be effective in removing ringing, with some parameter tweaking. Convolving the filters with the ringing time series should reveal where the optimal location to overlap them.

### 3.2 Goals

Convolve the 1D gabor filter, with a few different parameter settings, with the ringing time series, then take the product of the time series with the filter to see if the ringing can be removed. (8/5)

Add some paragraphs to the introduction section of the paper draft. (8/5)

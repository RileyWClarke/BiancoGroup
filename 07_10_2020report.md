# Riley Clarke - Week of 07/10/2020

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07080/>: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey I: Photometry of an L Dwarf Superflare

In this paper, the authors discuss a large white light flare observed in Kepler K2 Campaign 8 photometry. The flare is comparable in energy to the most power flares observed on the well-known flaring M4 dwarf GJ 1243. They speculate that highly energetic white light flares may be common among young L-dwarfs, which they attribute to their rapid rotation and weak spin-down.

### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Ran PCA process for 1000 lightcurves from campaign 4, plus 3 lightcurves from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*. 
Made phase-folded versions of the raw lightcurve as well as the PCA-reconstructed lightcurve.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

The PCA process worked well on the Campaign 4 lightcurves, with some similarities and differences to the Campaign 0 results. As shown in Figure 3, 
the first power series principle component's coefficients are entirely positive. However, the explained variance of the DFT PCs does not reach 95% until ~400 components,
so I decided to keep the first 400 components rather than 200 as was done with Campaign 0. 2 of the 3 TOIs have very high luminosity flares that produce 
some non-physical "ringing" signal in the region near the flare, which is an artifact of doing FFT on a quasi-discontinuity. The raw and processed lightcurve
of EPIC 211046195 was phase-folded, showing that the periodicity was not lost after processing.

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on recreating Figure 4 from *Gizis et al 2017* (or at least plotting the flares, maybe not the actual flare fits? Delivery: 7/15),
adding a quadratic fit to the phase-folded lightcurves (Delivery: 7/13), as well as adding some introductory text to the paper draft (Delivery: 7/15).

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266796250_Image_Deconvolution_Ringing_Artifact_Detection_and_Removal_via_PSF_Frequency_Analysis/>: 

In this paper, the authors discuss a method for detecting and removing ringing artifacts in 2D image processing. This method utilizes Gabor filters, which are sinusoidal planes of a particular frequency, wrapped in a Gaussian envelope. The artifact removal algorithm works by generating a set of Gabor filters for each non-zero frequency components of the PSF and then minimizing a likelihood function. However, this likelihood function is apparently computationally difficult to solve (for the 2D case, maybe?) and divides it into two sub-problems, which are alternated between until convergence is satisfied by a penalty parameter hitting some threshold. The paper demonstrates the algorithms' ability to detect and remove artifacts from various images, resulting in a deblurring effect. From the comparison images, it appears that the intensity of the ringing was reduced, but the artifacts were still visible in most comparisons.

### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Ran PCA process for 1000 lightcurves from campaign 4, plus 3 lightcurves from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*. 
Recreated (-ish) Figure 2 from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: My version of Figure 2 from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*, showing flares on EPIC 211046195. 
Vertical lines are added at the time of peak flare luminosity, as well as to show
the edges of the windows of the subplots in Figure 2 of *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

At a glance, it appears that the flares are preserved in at least some of the processed lightcurves. However, it's impossible to tell for sure when looking
at the 30 minute cadence lightcurves, since many flares are not resolved on that timescale. Hopefully, looking at the short cadence lightcurves will show the 
flares left undisturbed by the PCA processing.

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on implementing the ringing artifact removal algorithm outlined in:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266796250_Image_Deconvolution_Ringing_Artifact_Detection_and_Removal_via_PSF_Frequency_Analysis 
(Delivery: 7/24), as well as running the PCA process on the 2 minute cadence lightcurves Dr. Gizis sent, as well as recreating the flares figure (Delivery: 7/22).

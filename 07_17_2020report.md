# Riley Clarke - Week of 07/17/2020

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Ran PCA process for 1000 lightcurves from campaign 4, plus 3 lightcurves from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*. 
Recreated (-ish) Figure 2 from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: My version of Figure 2 from *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*, showing flares on EPIC 211046195. 
Vertical lines are added at the time of peak flare luminosity, as well as to show
the edges of the windows of the subplots in Figure 2 of *Gizis, Paudel, and Mullan 2017*.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

At a glance, it appears that the flares are preserved in at least some of the processed lightcurves. However, it's impossible to tell for sure when looking
at the 30 minute cadence lightcurves, since many flares are not resolved on that timescale. Hopefully, looking at the short cadence lightcurves will show the 
flares left undisturbed by the PCA processing.

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I will work on implementing the ringing artifact removal algorithm outlined in:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266796250_Image_Deconvolution_Ringing_Artifact_Detection_and_Removal_via_PSF_Frequency_Analysis 
(Delivery: 7/24), as well as running the PCA process on the 2 minute cadence lightcurves Dr. Gizis sent, as well as recreating the flares figure (Delivery: 7/22).

# Riley Clarke - Week of 06/19/2020

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read


### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Linearly interpolated gaps in 974 K2 (campaign 0) lightcurves. 

Obtained FFT power spectra of all lightcurves and ran Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on them.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: 1st principal component. The first peak is at a frequency of 3.94 / day, the successive peaks are likely harmonics.

Figure 2: Cumulative variance explained by successive coefficients. ~50% of the variance is explained by the first 2 coefficents.
The dotted black line is 95% explained variance.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

Was able to patch the gaps in the Campaign 0 lightcurves via linear interpolation. PCA results show that ~50% of the variance
in the in power spectra is explained by the first two components, both of which display characteristic peaks at around a 4/day,
which can be reasonably explained by instrumental noise. I also made boxplots of pca.transform of the first few components to 
examine the distribution of the coefficients, but the values are tightly concentrated at zero, but with many outliers. 

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I'll work on removing Principal Components 1 & 2, then reconstructing the power spectra with the remaining components.
The reconstructed power spectra can then be re-inverted with the FFT algorithm, recreating the original lightcurve with the 
instrumental frequencies removed. (Tentative delivery: 6/24) 

I will also continue investigating the distribution of the PCA coefficients.

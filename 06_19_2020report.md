## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10694/>: *Planetary statistics and forecasting for solar flares.* In this very recent (i.e. uploaded yesterday) Arxiv pre-print, the authors discuss some examples of non-stochastic relationships between M-X class solar flare occurances and the relative motions of the inner planets and Jupiter. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are used on the distribution of flare occurances as a function of the Earth-Venus angle vs a uniform distribution, resulting in a strong rejection of a hypothesis of randomness. They also apply machine learning techniques such as random forest classification, which was trained on the planetary angles data to predict days with or without flares, using 200 gradient-boosted trees. Across the entire timespan of the solar flare data, consisting of 15705 days total, 65% of days were correctly classified. 

### 1.2 Code Written

fftfiltering2.ipynb: Linearly interpolated gaps in 974 K2 (campaign 0) lightcurves. 

Obtained FFT power spectra of all lightcurves and ran Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on them.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: 1st principal component. The first peak is at a frequency of 3.94 / day, the successive peaks are likely harmonics.

Figure 2: Cumulative variance explained by successive coefficients. ~50% of the variance is explained by the first 2 coefficents.
The dotted black line is 95% explained variance.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

Was able to patch the gaps in the Campaign 0 lightcurves via linear interpolation. PCA results show that ~50% of the variance
in the in power spectra is explained by the first two components, both of which display characteristic peaks at around a 4/day,
which can be reasonably explained by instrumental noise. I also made boxplots of pca.transform of the first few components to 
examine the distribution of the coefficients, but the values are tightly concentrated at zero, but with many outliers. 

### 3.2 Goals

Next week, I'll work on removing Principal Components 1 & 2, then reconstructing the power spectra with the remaining components.
The reconstructed power spectra can then be re-inverted with the FFT algorithm, recreating the original lightcurve with the 
instrumental frequencies removed. (Tentative delivery: 6/24) 

I will also continue investigating the distribution of the PCA coefficients.

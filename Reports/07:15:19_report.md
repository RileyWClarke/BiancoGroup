# Riley Clarke - Week of 07/15/2019

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read/Reading:

\<https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03494\>: The Kepler Catalog of Stellar Flares. Davenport, James R. A. 2016 

(Rereading this for info about FFDs and fitting broken power laws)

### 1.2 Code Written

BiancoGroup2019.ipynb: Added new FFD plots with last point removed and Kepler magnitudes from Table 1 of Paudel et al. 2018 added.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1: Same FFDs from previous reports, but the last (highest-energy) data point from each diagram has been pruned. Kepler-band magnitudes from Paudel et al. are added to figure titles.

## 3 Results 

In Figure 1, when comparing the FFDs of the two M6.5 stars, the flattening-out at low flare energies is very apparent in the star with K_p = 14.66 but not so much in the star with K_p = 16.72. You also do not observe the turn-off in the less luminous of the two M8 stars. This seems like the opposite of the expected - Shouldn't it be easier to detect the lowest-energy flares on stars where the background luminosity is smaller?

Still planning on fitting broken power laws with an MCMC routine, but need to do some literature/documentation review to figure out how to do that.

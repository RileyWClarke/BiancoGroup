Figure 2: Original power spectrum of the lightcurve vs the sigmoid-filtered power spectrum. The sigmoid is centered at 0.11 and its amplitude is multiplied by 5000 so that it's visible.

Figure 3: Original power spectrum of the lightcurve vs the gaussian-filtered power spectrum. The gaussian is centered at 0.05 with a standard deviation of 0.005. Its amplitude is multiplied by 5000 so that it's visible.


## 3 Results 

Before we go about calculating the rolling ED, we need to preprocess the lightcurve to remove any underlying signal due to spacecraft systematics, background contamination, etc.  A background signal can be filtered out of the lightcurve by taking the FFT and multiplying the power spectrum by an inverted gaussian centered on the undesired frequency, then taking the inverse Fourier transform of the result. Alternatively a sigmoid may be used to remove all frequencies above/below some value. In Figures 2 & 3 I applied both a sigmoid and gaussian to the lightcurve's power spectrum. Some additional tweaking on the filter parameters may be necessary, and it might be desirable to remove the peak around 0.1 with a second gaussian filter. Next step will be to take the inverse Fourier transform of the filtered PS and plot it. Having some trouble matching the array of the filtered PS to the time array of the original lightcurve.

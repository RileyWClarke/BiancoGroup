\<https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07631\>: K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey. V. High superflare rates on rapidly rotating late-M dwarfs.  

Summary: This paper presents a survey of superflares on 3 young (~700 Myr), late (M7-M9) M-dwarfs with short rotation periods: 0.193, 0.292, 0.556 days. The flares of these young rapid rotators have consistently shallower power-law slopes in their FFDs compared to older stars of the same spectral type. TRAPPIST-1, a well-known M8 dwarf was primarily used for comparison. This survey lends further support to the idea that stellar rotation drives production of high-energy flares. The authors additionally discuss how the elevated super flare rate among young, late M-dwarfs could impact their habitable zones, noting that occasional super flares could actually benefit the development of organic life, e.g. superflares could reduce thick H/He atmospheric envelopes and prevent the planet from becoming a Venusian "hothouse."

### 1.2 Code Written

BiancoGroup2019.ipynb: Added heatmap/matrix of results of a 2-sample Anderson-Darling test performed on the flare energy distributions from Paudel et al 2018. Also solved issues with making FFDs from last week and made FFDs corresponding to each flare energy histogram.

Figure 3: Results of 2-sample Anderson-Darling test. A value of 1 indicates that the null hypothesis (the two distributions are NOT related) can be rejected, whereas a value of 0 indicates lack of sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## 3 Results 

Thanks to Dr. Gizis' expert advice (i.e. telling me that the FFD is a CUMULATIVE distribution), I was able to replicate Rishi's FFDs from the K2 Ultracool Dwarfs Survey III, as seen in Figure 2. Next steps will involve fitting lines (i.e. power-laws) to the FFDs.

In Figure 3, I display the results of the 2-sample Anderson-Darling at a 5% confidence level. Like the K-S test results, these results indicate differences in flare energy distribution even between stars of the same spectral type.
